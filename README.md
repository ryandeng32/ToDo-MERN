# ToDo MERN
> A ToDo list built with the MERN stack 
- Inspired by the Udemy course "The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp" by Angela Yu
- In the course, Angela codes a ToDo list with Express and EJS 
- This repository is my remake of this ToDo list with **React** as the frontend and communicating with the backend with **axios (MERN stack)**
